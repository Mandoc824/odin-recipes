    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The little puddle of fat floating on top of a pot of birria is pure gold,
      stained red from chiles, and rich with all the concentrated flavors of the
      original stew. In other words: Don’t waste it! Instead, spoon the fat off
      the top of the broth and reserve it for crisping tortillas to make
      quesabirria tacos, pan-fried until crisp, with cheese smushing out of the
      edges and browning in the pan. You can enjoy the tacos with salsas or hot
      sauce, but the birria meat and cooking oil are so flavorful that a little
      cilantro and onion are all you really need.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1/4 cup seasoned birria fat plus 1 cup leftover birria meat (both from
          Birria de Res)
        </li>
        <li>4 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded low-moisture cheese, such as Monterey Jack</li>
        <li>1/4 white onion</li>
        <li>1 handful fresh cilantro leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>1 lime, quartered</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use a spoon to skim the red-stained fat floating on the top of the
          birria pot — it’s deeply seasoned and the key to crisp, delicious
          tacos — and put it on a plate. Pull the meat and shred it with your
          hands, or a fork. (The meat should be very lightly dressed in broth,
          but not swimming in it.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium. Working
          quickly, dip each tortilla into the birria fat on one side then flop
          it onto the hot pan, fat-side down. As it starts to sizzle, sprinkle
          1/4 cup cheese to cover each tortilla, going all the way to the edges,
          then sprinkle about 1/4 cup meat over half of each tortilla.
        </li>
        <li>
          As the tortillas brown and the cheese starts to melt, fold each
          tortilla in half to cover the meat, pressing down gently. It’s OK if
          some cheese spills out, in fact, it’s encouraged; this leads to lacy,
          crispy edges. Manage the heat and flip the tacos as needed to avoid
          burning, cooking until crisp on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>
          Just before eating, lift up the taco edge and season each with a
          little onion, cilantro and lime juice, to taste.
        </li>
      </ol>
