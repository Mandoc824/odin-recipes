      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a medium-sized bowl, add the flour, baking powder, cayenne, garlic
          powder, salt, and pepper, whisk to combine, set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the buttermilk and the egg
          until combined, set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start heating up your oil to 325°F. I like to use a dutch oven for
          this. You can also use a deep fryer or a large skillet with deep
          sides. You need about 3 inches of oil up the side of the pan. Make
          sure you do not overfill the skillet if you are using it, when adding
          the tenders the oil will rise.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the oil heats, bread the tenders. Do this one tender at a time.
        </li>
        <li>Place tender into the flour mixture. Shake off any excess.</li>
        <li>
          Place it into the buttermilk mixture and coat the tender well, let any
          excess drip off.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place it back into the flour mixture, coat the tender in the flour and
          pat down the flour on the tender so it sticks well and forms a crust.
          Shake off any excess flour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, place the tenders very carefully into the hot oil. Fry for about
          3-5 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F.
          Place the tenders on a wire rack above a sheet tray while you fry the
          remaining tenders.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the butter into a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Let the
          butter melt then add the brown sugar, cayenne, garlic powder, onion
          powder, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk to combine and continue to whisk until the sugar dissolves and
          the sauce comes together for about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Brush the tenders with the sauce and serve.</li>
      </ol>
