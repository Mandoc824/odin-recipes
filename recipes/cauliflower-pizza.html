    <p>
      You are looking at the best cauliflower pizza crust on the web! It is
      crispy, cheesy and you can really hold the slice. Healthy dinner is
      served. I will not lie, the crust doesnâ€™t taste like traditional pizza
      crust. Or that recipe is not time consuming. But crust is super tasty and
      I highly recommend to make 2 crusts!

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 head cauliflower</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment
          paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Break the cauliflower into florets and pulse in a food processor until
          fine. Steam in a steamer basket and drain well. (I like to put it on a
          towel to get all the moisture out.) Let cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a bowl, combine the cauliflower with the mozzarella, Parmesan,
          oregano, salt, garlic powder and eggs. Transfer to the center of the
          baking sheet and spread into a circle, resembling a pizza crust. Bake
          for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add desired toppings and bake an additional 10 minutes.</li>
      </ol>
