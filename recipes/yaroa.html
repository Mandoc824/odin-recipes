    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Yaroa is a Dominican dish that consists of a layer of boiled and mashed
      ripe plantains -- or French fries -- topped with shredded or minced meat,
      cheese, and drizzled with mayo and ketchup [1]. Yaroa is a dish that was
      created and made popular in Santiago by street food vendors (carritos).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two type of yaroas: yaroa de plátano maduro (yellow or ripe
      plantain yaroa) and yaroa de papa frita (French fries yaroa). We'll be
      making the potato fries version.

        <h3>Fries:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Seasoning the fries:</strong> Drizzle the potato or celeriac
            with the olive oil, and add the remaining salt, as well as the
            pepper, and garlic powder. Toss to coat them all in the oil and
            seasoning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cooking the fries:</strong> Place on a baking sheet and cook
            in preheated oven to 350 ºF [175 ºC] for 25 minutes, or until they
            turn a light golden color and are crispy around the edges. If you
            want to make them in the air fryer, use the temperature and time
            suggested by the manufacturer.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook meat:</strong> Heat oil over medium-low heat. Stir in
            onion and cook and stir until it turns translucent. Add garlic and
            cook stirring for a minute. Add minced meat and cook and stir,
            breaking into small clumps until it browns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Season:</strong> Pour in tomato sauce, add bell pepper,

            plates. Top with the steaming-hot meat. Sprinkle with mozzarella and
            cheddar. The hot meat should melt the cheese, but if it doesn't,
            heat the plates in the microwave for 90 seconds, or until the cheese
            melts. Drizzle with mayo and ketchup and serve right away.
